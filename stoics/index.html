                <h1>Stoicism</h1>
                
                <p>Stoicism is a philosophical school of thought that originated in ancient Greece, primarily in Athens, around the 3rd century BC. It was founded by Zeno of Citium and later developed by philosophers such as Epictetus, Seneca the Younger, and Marcus Aurelius. Key tenets of Stoicism include virtue as the highest good, acceptance of what is beyond our control, living in accordance with nature, practicing mindfulness and self-awareness, and fostering endurance and resilience in the face of adversity.</p>
