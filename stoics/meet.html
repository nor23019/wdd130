                <h2>Zeno of Citium</h2>
                
                <p>Zeno of Citium (c. 334 - c. 262 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher credited as the founder of Stoicism. Born in Citium, Cyprus, he later moved to Athens, where he established his philosophical school. Zeno's Stoic teachings emphasized living in accordance with nature, cultivating virtue, and maintaining inner tranquility. Although many of his writings have been lost, his ideas were further developed by later Stoic philosophers such as Cleanthes, Chrysippus, Epictetus, Seneca the Younger, and Marcus Aurelius. Zeno's legacy as the founder of Stoicism has had a profound and enduring influence on Western philosophy, shaping ideas about ethics, resilience, and the pursuit of wisdom.

            <h2>Seneca the Younger</h2>
            
            <p>Seneca the Younger (c. 4 BC - AD 65) was a prominent Roman statesman, dramatist, and Stoic philosopher. Born in Corduba (in modern-day Spain), Seneca rose to prominence in Rome as an advisor and tutor to the emperor Nero. He is best known for his philosophical works, which include letters, essays, and dialogues that emphasize Stoic principles such as the pursuit of virtue, self-discipline, and acceptance of fate. Seneca's philosophical writings, such as "Letters to Lucilius" and "On the Shortness of Life," remain influential today for their insights into human nature, ethics, and the art of living a meaningful life. Despite his philosophical beliefs, Seneca faced challenges navigating the political intrigues of his time and was eventually forced to commit suicide by Nero's orders.

            <h2>Marcus Aurelius</h2>

            <p>Marcus Aurelius (121 - 180 AD) was a Roman Emperor and one of the most renowned Stoic philosophers. He ruled from 161 AD until his death in 180 AD, during a period known as the Pax Romana, characterized by relative peace and stability throughout the Roman Empire. Marcus Aurelius is best known for his philosophical writings, particularly his personal journal titled "Meditations." In "Meditations," Marcus Aurelius reflects on Stoic principles and offers guidance on how to live a virtuous life, cope with adversity, and find inner peace. Despite the demands of his imperial duties, Marcus Aurelius remained committed to Stoic philosophy, advocating for self-discipline, rationality, and moral integrity. His writings continue to inspire people around the world seeking wisdom and guidance in navigating life's challenges.

            <h2>Epictetus</h2>
            
            <p>Epictetus (c. 55 - c. 135 AD) was an ancient Greek Stoic philosopher born in Hierapolis, Phrygia (present-day Pamukkale, Turkey). Despite being born a slave, Epictetus gained his freedom and became one of the most influential Stoic philosophers. He studied under Musonius Rufus, another prominent Stoic teacher, and later established his own school in Nicopolis, Greece. Epictetus's teachings emphasized the importance of accepting what is within our control, cultivating inner peace, and living in accordance with nature. His discourses, compiled by his student Arrian, form the basis of his philosophical teachings. One of his most famous works is the "Enchiridion," or "Handbook," which provides practical advice on how to live a virtuous life. Epictetus's Stoic philosophy continues to be revered for its timeless wisdom and practical guidance in navigating life's challenges with resilience and moral integrity.</p>
